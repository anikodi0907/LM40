## Case
I wanted to keep the design fairly simple while looking good at the same time.

It has a 7 degree typing angle and a 12 degree curve for ergonomics.

There nothing special about the case, just looks clean. On the bottom there's a badge sort of thing. 

The case is designed to be 3d printed.
As it's 3d printed, it'll be using heated inserts for screwing in the plate and the case.

It is a top mounted keyboard with 6 mounting points. 


## PCB
The pcb will be a hotswap pcb with a daughter board. 

It has no flex cuts.

The mcu will be embedded into the pcb and it'll be using Atmega 32u4 and it is designed by 'the emperor'.

Thanks to ani and the emperor for helping me with the design and pcb.
